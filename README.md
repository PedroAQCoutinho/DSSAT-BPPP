# DSSAT-BPPP
## BRAZILIAN PASTURE POTENTIAL PRODUCTIVITY

### "What is DSSAT?
Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) is software application program that comprises dynamic crop growth simulation models for over 42 crops. DSSAT is supported by a range of utilities and apps for weather, soil, genetic, crop management, and observational experimental data, and includes example data sets for all crop models. The crop simulation models simulate growth, development and yield as a function of the soil-plant-atmosphere dynamics. (https://dssat.net/)"

This repository contains input data and R scripts for preparing auxiliar files and run DSSAT model for a bunch of simulation points in Brazil. Since the user friendly interface of DSSAT wasnt enough to run the model more than 9000 times, I made this sequence of scripts to automate the runs.
